# Unit Testing with Jest

> By Keili Rosales

## Objective

The main objective of this interactive exercise is to learn how to use the Jest Framework, to create my first unit tests, through the creation of functions able to convert numeric values from one currency to another, such as from dollar to yen, from euro to dollar, and finally from yen to pound sterling.

## Application

1. Run the project using: `npm run start`.
2. Check the results of the currency conversion tests.

## Technologies

- Javascript
- Jest

## Contributions
